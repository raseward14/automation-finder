# app idea

This could potentially be a task creation app that creates apps that automatically priovide the task with geotagging information.

- OAUTH flow implemented so that anyone that uses it Authorizes the app to create tasks, and create a Location Custom Field at the Everything level of the Workspace - clickup API
- a create task form - clickup API
- a location service - https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp HTML Geolocation API - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API MDM web docs on Geolocation API - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview Google Geolocation API (I already have cridentials for this one I believe)

So essentially the user authorizes the integration, then can use the app to create tasks that are always geocoded on a Custom Field with their current location.
